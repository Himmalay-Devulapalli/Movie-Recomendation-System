# Movie-Recomendation-System

Python GUI based Movie recommendation system. This application uses imdbpy an api for collecting real time movie data.
Used Tkinter module for GUI.

This application is a basic version of a movie recommendation system.

# Further Development and Details

1) Clone the repository
2) Install the necessary modules using requirements.txt file.
3) Run the main.py file
4) At the very first time you execute the python file  a config file is generated which can be used to store the user interests for further predictions.
5) You can only see this home page when you run the python file for the first time or when the config file is missing.

You can use this window to save the user's interest and write it to config file so the data dosen't vanish evertime you restart the application.

6) This is the main menu where all the app features can  be shown. I have created only 2 features that are search movie by name and search movie by actor

7) By clicking on each button new window is rendered. This is how search movie by name looks like.

9) I also gave a feature that can predict the movies based on the genres.This works by taking the users interst and further suggests random movies based on the genres
   the user requested.

10) This is just a basic architecture of movie recommendation system.This application can be improved in many better ways.
